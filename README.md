# Preliminary-Training-Assignment-Solution
Solution for Assignment in Preliminary Training Before Entering the Real Code

There are 2 tasks (for now) to begin with : <br>
1. Approximating boundary layer parameters (displacement thickness, momentum thickness, drag coefficient, etc.) for various velocity profiles and compared to Blausius results on flow over flat plate. This problem focuses on syntaxing, numerical method (numerical integration and numerical derivative) and design thinking. 
2. Solving the original Blausius' equation numerically using shooting method, and solving the transformed Blausius' equation (Crocco's equation). The problem now consists of solving ODE numerically in semi-infinite domain and domain with singularity.

Note :

You are allowed to complete task 1 as inefficient as you want (no parallelization, code optimization etc). However, starting task 2 and the next tasks, you are EXTREMELY REQUIRED to make the code as efficient (space and time complexity) as possible, since you will need it intensively in the real code.
